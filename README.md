This repository is home to the metadata that drives the provider and module registry for [OpenTofu](https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu)

It also contains the applications used to manage version bumping, validation and API generation of the registry that is hosted at [registry.opentofu.org](https://registry.opentofu.org).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Please note this registry is a work in progress, and we are not currently accepting any new providers or modules from external contributors at this time until a full validation process has been put in place.
